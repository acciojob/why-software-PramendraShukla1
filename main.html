	    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
      Becoming a software developer offers a pathway to creativity,
      problem-solving, and continuous learning that few other professions can
      match. As a software developer, I am drawn to the field because of its
      dynamic nature and the ability to create solutions that impact people's
      lives in meaningful ways.
